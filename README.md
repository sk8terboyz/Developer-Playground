# Developer Playground

Author: Shane Kennedy

### The idea:
This website is where I want to develop fun/random projects. It will be a fully functioning website, but I am going to try to stay away from server-based projects for awhile. Right now I want to work within the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JQuery and Bootstrap are libraries I am fairly familiar with so I am using these to help, and I hope to use NodeJS later on.
    
### Libraries:
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- NodeJS (not currently added, but I expect to add it later on)
    
### Projects:
- Developing Projects
    - Popcorn
        - This will be a game where kernals will fly around the screen for the user to click on. Once a kernal is "popped" (clicked on) it will burst into popcorn and add to the player's score.
    - Dice
        - I want to recreate some classic games with dice, so right now this is just a playground for developing each aspect of the dice.
- Active Projects
    - Active projects are any projects that have the core functionality working. This does not mean they are complete, just working.
    - Branches
        - This is a recreation I made following MrDoob's system (https://mrdoob.com/#/111/branching). Whenever the user clicks, a branch structure is created and branches are created continuously until it dies out. I have added a "Switch-Up" button to change the background color of the canvas and an adjustable slider to change the speed of the branches (currently the slider is not working).
        - The only part that doesn't work is the slider that attempts to change the speed of the branching. Unfortunately this isn't working yet, but is not required.
    - Bezier Curve
        - This project is going to be used to help me complete the popcorn game. The bezier curve is the basic functionality of creating a changeable curve with JS. I am following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7adUs4o2_JM made by user Qixotl LFC on YouTube.
    - Explanation
        - The explanation page is where each of my projects/pages will be explained. I plan for all of the data to be grabbed from a separate data file. Currently this is setup to get the data from the projects.json file where all information about the projects is consolidated. This page will hopefully benefit the user in having a single page to get brief descriptions of each project without having to find this README.md file.
    - Basics
        - This page is created to put fairly simple and basic projects on so that I don't need to create a new page for each of them. These are all projects that I consider to be easy to develop. I also plan to use this page to build basic versions of components used in the other projects. I realized this would be useful after I created the Bezier Curve project to understand the movement I wanted for the seeds/popcorn in the Popcorn project. Now I won't need to create all new webpages, but just add it to this page.
    
### Potential Ideas:
- Recreations (already finished and/or on github)
    - Hangman
    - Branches
    - Snake 
    - Radar (could turn this into a game as a sonar radar)
    - Grocery List
- Project Ideas
    - JQuery game (already started but not finished)
    - Yahtzee
    - Hide n' Seek? (more like a Where's Waldo style)
        - Character pops up and player has X seconds to click on it before it disappears
    - Calculator
        - Basic calculator is easy, so probably an extensive calculator (not nearly as much as symbolab)
    - Animation Playground
        - Dedicate a page for just playing around with animation styles with JavaScript or CSS
    - 3D Mapping of environments
        - I've been wanting to get into 3D mapping for awhile now, but that may be something restricted towards non web-based languages. I will look into this later on.
    - Bouncy Balls/Ball Pit
        - Bouncy Balls should be doable after I figure out the bouncing kernals in the popcorn game

## Problems:
- Random User Issue (UNRESOLVED)
    - My friend tried cloning the repository and when he launched it, the About, Basics, and Bezier Curve pages were broken in one way or another
    - Fix Ideas:
        - I'm at a loss
