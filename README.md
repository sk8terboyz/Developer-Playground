# Developer Playground

Author: Shane Kennedy

The idea:
    This website is where I want to develop fun/random projects. It will be a fully functioning website, but I am going to try to stay away from server-based projects for awhile. Right now I want to work within the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JQuery and Bootstrap are libraries I am fairly familiar with so I am using these to help, and I hope to use NodeJS later on.
    
Libraries:
- JQuery
- Bootstrap
- NodeJS (not currently added, but I expect to add it later on)
    
Projects:
- Active Projects
    - Popcorn
        - This will be a game where kernals will fly around the screen for the user to click on. Once a kernal is "popped" (clicked on) it will burst into popcorn and add to the player's score.
    - Dice
        - I want to recreate some classic games with dice, so right now this is just a playground for developing each aspect of the dice.
     - Branches
            - This is a recreation I made following MrDoob's system (https://mrdoob.com/#/111/branching). Whenever the user clicks, a tree structure is created and branches are created continuously until it dies out. I have added a "Switch-Up" button to change the background color of the canvas and an adjustable slider to change the speed of the branches (currently the slider is not working).
            - Currently the branching logic works just fine, but the styling is all messed up because it was originally made to be its own page and not with a navbar or anything, so I need to fix these issues.
    - Finished Projects
    
Potential Ideas:
    - Recreations (already finished & on github)
        - Hangman
        - Branches
        - Snake 
        - Radar (could turn this into a game as a sonar radar)
    - Project Ideas
        - JQuery game (already started but not finished)
        - Yahtzee
        - Hide n' Seek? (more like a Where's Waldo style)
            - Character pops up and player has X seconds to click on it before it disappears
        - Calculator
            - Basic calculator is easy, so probably an extensive calculator (not nearly as much as symbolab)
        - Animation Playground
            - Dedicate a page for just playing around with animation styles with JavaScript or CSS
        - 3D Mapping of environments
            - I've been wanting to get into 3D mapping for awhile now, but that may be something restricted towards non web-based languages. I will look into this later on.
